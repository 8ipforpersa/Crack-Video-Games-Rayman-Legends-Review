## Gameplay
     
Rayman Legends is a 2D side-scrolling platformer that retains the gameplay style of its predecessor, Rayman Origins. The player controls one of the five playable characters: Rayman, Globox, Barbara, or one of the two Teensies. The player can also switch to Murfy in certain levels by pressing a button or touching the screen. Murfy can perform various actions, such as cutting ropes, moving platforms, tickling enemies, or activating mechanisms.
     
The main objective of the game is to rescue the Teensies from each level. There are 10 Teensies in each level, and some of them are hidden or require certain actions to be freed. The player can also collect Lums, which are yellow creatures that serve as the game's currency. Lums can be used to unlock new characters, costumes, and paintings that lead to new levels. The game also features special levels called "Invasion" levels, which are time-limited and require the player to reach the end as fast as possible while avoiding obstacles and enemies.
     
The game also features musical levels, which are levels that sync with the rhythm of a song. The player has to jump, slide, punch, and kick in sync with the music to progress through the level. The game also features boss battles, which are challenging levels that require the player to defeat a powerful enemy using their skills and abilities.
     
## Reception
     
Rayman Legends received critical acclaim from critics and players alike. The game was praised for its colorful graphics, charming characters, varied gameplay, creative level design, catchy soundtrack, and fun multiplayer modes. The game was also lauded for its content and replay value, as it offers over 120 levels to play and explore. Some of the criticisms of the game were directed at its difficulty curve, which can be frustrating for some players; its lack of online co-op mode; and its implementation of Murfy on some platforms, which can be awkward or imprecise.
     
The game has won several awards and nominations from various gaming publications and events, such as Game Informer, IGN, Destructoid, GameSpot, BAFTA Games Awards, Golden Joystick Awards, The Game Awards, and more. The game has also sold over 4 million copies worldwide as of 2016.
